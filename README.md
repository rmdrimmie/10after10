# 10after10.com

A website that details and tracks the progress of 10 projects.

These projects are primarily worked on after the kids are in bed.

## Projects

### (10) The website
Considered squarespace but for now I'm poking around with github pages.

This is a fairly straight-forward site, primarily brochure-style, though perhaps with some posting capabilities - my impression is that it is quite straightforward to set that up with jekyll and markdown so I will experiment.

The background of the site is a clock face, with the hour hand at 10 and the minute hand at 2 (for, I hope, obvious reasons).

The second hand changes depending on which project's details are being viewed. The main page, which overviews the entire project, has the second hand at 12, then each project moves the second hand forward.

### (9) - (1) ??
Some of the ones that have been rattling around my brain for a while and are particularly interesting:

- blastula (project definition app)
- jowka (rhythm game)
- baby newt (forum)
- xmpp "boss" (self improvement)
- animated gif maker
- shower ideas
- rsslow
- doris 
- rdc
