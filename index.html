      10 after 10 is a collections of projects that I am playing with.
    </p><p>
      The work for these projects occurs, for the most part, after my 
      kids are asleep. As a result the majority of effort occurs 
      after 10pm.
    </p><p>
      But really that's a bit of post hoc justification for the url. I 
      registered the domain after thinking about the time '10:10', which 
      is entertaining to me for a number of reasons, high among them the
      connection to the binary number 1010, which in decimal is 10.
    </p><p>
      The first project is this site itself. For now it is a github page
      which lets me experiment with jekyll and effectively grants me free
      hosting. It's going to grow and change over time.
    </p><p>
      Future projects are to be announced, but there will be 9 more.
